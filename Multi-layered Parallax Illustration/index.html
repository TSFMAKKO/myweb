                        <h1>You cannot hide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces
                            of a simple honest heart.</h1>

                        <p>And besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan, which even his
                            uncouthness could not altogether maim. He looked like a man who had never cringed and never
                            had had a creditor. Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn
                            out in freer and brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would, this I
                            will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent
                            one.</p>
                        <p>It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington's head, as seen in the
                            popular busts of him. It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the
                            brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on
                            top. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.</p>
                        <p>Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be looking out at the
                            storm from the casement, he never heeded my presence, never troubled himself with so much as
                            a single glance; but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous
                            book. Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous, and
                            especially considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the
                            morning, I thought this indifference of his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at
                            times you do not know exactly how to take them.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class='col-sm-6'>
                        <p>At first they are overawing; their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic
                            wisdom. I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with
                            the other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared to have no desire to
                            enlarge the circle of his acquaintances. All this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon
                            second thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty
                            thousand miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is—which was the only way he could
                            get there—thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter; and
                            yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the utmost serenity; content with his own
                            companionship; always equal to himself.</p>

                            touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that.
